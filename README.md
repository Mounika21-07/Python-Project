# Python-Project

### Python Data Processing & Analysis  
 
**Situation:**  
- Analyzed and processed structured datasets using Python to demonstrate data manipulation and transformation techniques.  
 
**Task:**  
- Developed a Python-based solution to clean, transform, and analyze datasets using NumPy and Pandas.  
 
**Action:**  
- Created and saved DataFrames from CSV files.  
- Handled missing values using replacement techniques.  
- Performed column splitting, removal, and conditional updates (e.g., bonus percentage, designation demotion, name prefix addition).  
- Merged multiple DataFrames and filtered employees based on city.  
- Calculated total project cost and analyzed employee data trends.  
 
**Result:**  
- Streamlined data processing workflows, improving efficiency in handling large datasets.  
- Enhanced decision-making by providing structured and cleaned data for further analysis.
